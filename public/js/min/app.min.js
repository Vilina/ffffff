I plug my ipad into my projector and my students get a very robust and visually appealing smart board service for 6 bucks a month.  Also, I record a lecture for each of my classes every day of class.  Absent students are always caught up, students who need intervention have another level of RTI and I have an authentic way to produce visually appealing content.  ShowMe allows for an educator to use PDFs of notes that match their student's 100%, and take any screen shot and import to annotate.  I have hit around 30,000 views in my three years of using ShowMe as a smartboard and I am very grateful for what I can accomplish with this fiscally cheap, yet luxurious application.",profilePictureUrl:"./public/images/testimonials/colin_ohaire.jpg"},{name:"Shauna O'Flynn",signature:"Math teacher at Pearl River Middle School",testimonial:"I was hesitant at first to use Showme, however now I cannot imagine my classroom without it!  I use it to reteach lessons so students can reinforce lessons at home.  It even helps parents help their children better at home.   I leave the videos embedded on my website for the whole school year so students can refer back to them as needed.  I also use it when I am going to be absent from class so that my students don't miss a day of math class.  At different points in the year I even have the students create accounts and create their own showme videos (with parental permission of course!)

Students watch a short video prior to coming to class.

I travel around the county now, serving five different middle schools.   Not only am I able to virtually visit the students everyday, but I can also instruct the teachers!     If I am supplementing or enriching instruction, I can quickly create a ShowMe to share.
